several private keys under the same wallet. The goal of a multisig is the same as any crypto wallet solution, to manage crypto assets. Such wallets create redundancy by requiring more than one private key signature to authorize a transaction. Indeed, Smart wallets rely on a group of exclusive key pairs. Wallet owners are able to set up the minimum number of signatures required for the wallet to authorize any transaction. Therefore they are able to distribute the keys associated with the main wallet to other parties, decentralizing the responsibility of managing the funds. Practically, this means that multiple parties must sign off on a transaction before it is authorized and validated.
