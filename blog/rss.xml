            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the past years, Android strengthened its leadership among all mobile operating systems, with an average of approximately 70.96% of the market share. Most of its success is no mere temporary surge because of the developer-friendly application development process. Google offers a plethora of platforms that support the design and development, testing, and sharing of their applications. Consequently, the number of applications in the Google Play Store reached 2.6 million in 2022. </p><p>However, to put that another way, from a security standpoint, the remarkable growth of Android coupled with the fact that a large number of innocent mobile users may become potential victims of cyber attacks. One of the prevalent types of attack is something called repackaging. Repackaging refers to the practice of customizing an existing mobile app and redistributing it in the wild. Specifically, attackers modify a popular app downloaded from app markets, reverse-engineer the app, inject some malicious code, and redistribute the modified app. Because it is difficult for regular users to notice the difference between the repackaged app and the original app, victims may suffer financial loss, mainly when security-critical private and business apps they use, such as Crypto Exchange apps, are repackaged.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="repackaged-android-apps">Repackaged Android Apps<a class="hash-link" href="#repackaged-android-apps" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Some may get astounded by the fact that Android app is prone to repackaging. We can say that Android is negligent in such an attack. That's because of the intrinsical relation to the structural characteristics of the app distribution process. The app requires "ANY" valid signature to be successfully installed — they do not verify the actual identity of the signer. The app developer (even including the bad actor!) does not need a legitimate public key certificate issued by a trusted authority, indicating the possibility that an actor can modify an existing app, inject some harmful codes, and re-sign it with the self-generated private key. </p><p>What happens when you have installed the repackaged app on your mobile device? Based on our experience,</p><ul><li>Plifering cryptocurrencies</li><li>Stealing your credentials (Account Information, Passport Copy for KYC, ...)</li><li>Leaking your secret phrases</li><li>Or... almost everything you can imagine is possible!</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-helpful-guidelines-for-giving-the-app-a-check">2 helpful guidelines for giving the app a check<a class="hash-link" href="#2-helpful-guidelines-for-giving-the-app-a-check" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Whether you're downloading an app as a customer or as a developer NOT via the official app store such as Google Play, there are some essential guidelines and tips that you need to consider to guarantee the safety of your device. Let's check them out!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="protip-1-establish-trust-via-download-links">Protip 1. Establish trust via download links.<a class="hash-link" href="#protip-1-establish-trust-via-download-links" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When reading a blog post, you may find they are hosting a third-party download. Clicking the button may lead to potential problems — you must validate the address beforehand. In the case of Binance, the address should be <a href="https://download.binance.com/pack/BNApp.apk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://download.binance.com/pack/BNApp.apk</a>, as shown in the picture below.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-1" src="/hashdit/assets/images/1-0542c479d34e2f6725e4de759926a5ec.png" width="439" height="659" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>But remember, scammers are becoming more innovative and intelligent, and they can disguise the URL to make it look safe. The malicious URL can be various: <code>https://download.b1nance.com/</code> or <code>https://download.blnance.co/</code>. Although you find the post with no apparent problem, please proceed cautiously!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="protip-2-check-the-digital-signature">Protip 2. Check the digital signature.<a class="hash-link" href="#protip-2-check-the-digital-signature" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>With a tool called apksigner, you can check the app's authenticity. The apksigner tool, available in revision 24.0.3 and higher of the Android SDK Build Tools, lets you sign APKs and confirm that an APK's signature will be verified successfully on all Android platform-supported versions by that APK. Make a comparison between the original and repackaged versions — you may immediately sense the difference.</p><p>The syntax for confirming the successful verification of an APK's signature on supported platforms is as follows:</p><p><code>apksigner verify [options] app-name.apk</code></p><p>The apksigner verify command has the following options.</p><p><strong>--print-certs</strong></p><p>Show information about the APK's signing certificates.</p><p><strong>--min-sdk-version \&lt;integer<!-- -->&gt;</strong></p><p>The lowest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK's signature will be verified. Higher values allow the tool to use more robust security parameters when signing the app but limit the APK's availability to devices running more recent versions of Android. By default, apksigner uses the value of the minSdkVersion attribute from the app's manifest file.</p><p><strong>--max-sdk-version \&lt;integer<!-- -->&gt;</strong></p><p>The highest Android framework API level that apksigner uses to confirm that the APK's signature will be verified. By default, the tool uses the highest possible API level.</p><p><strong>-v, --verbose</strong></p><p>Use the verbose output mode.</p><p><strong>-Werr</strong></p><p>Treat warnings as errors.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>You should only trust apps obtained from official app stores. Suppose you ever downloaded the Binance app from third-party markets or have already installed it. In that case, you are probably at risk — immediate action is required: change your password, factory reset your device, fresh-install it from our official host, and please contact us for assistance.</p><p>Other apps also can be a potential backdoor. Once you use the repackaged app, the lousy actor can annoy you in countless programmatically unimaginable ways. Telegram is a good example: Binance Security Team once ever stumbled across an unofficial Telegram app replacing crypto wallet addresses with the bad actors' ones on-the-fly.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2021, crypto scams were a growing attack vector tricking victims into investing in the crypto space. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/03/crypto-scams-cost-people-more-than-1-billion-since-2021-ftc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>, more than $1 billion were lost to crypto scams in 2021, where the most common types include fake investments and romance scams.  </p><p>Since then, 2022 has shown that scammers are getting more and more creative.</p><p>As a leader in securing the BNB Chain ecosystem, it is our duty to keep users in the BNB Chain ecosystem safe by making sure they are always one step ahead of these scammers. Here are the most popular scams this year:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-phishing-link-scams">1: Phishing Link Scams<a class="hash-link" href="#1-phishing-link-scams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Phishing is already a popular technique used by scammers in Web 2. This is because scammers can just create a malicious website and subsequently mass send the links to their victims. Here, we will focus mostly on ways that the scammers will try to steal your private keys. </p><p>In Web 3, scammers usually send their phishing links through different mediums where the Web3 community is, like Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and even On-Chain.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-2" src="/hashdit/assets/images/2-6eb7c3d28234f88d42485308433b0316.png" width="512" height="131" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Phishing websites usually look like the real website, but with different url names. They can be about a new giveaway or NFT pre-mint events, basically any situation that will make the user feel excited (FOMO - Fear Of Missing Out) and not think straight. The scammer takes advantage of the user’s emotional instability.</p><p>They can blatantly be asking for the user to provide his seed phrase or private key. For example, contacting  users on  social media,reaching out as wallet software support and jumping in with direct messages spoofing as an Exchange Support to steal one’s private key directly.</p><p>Another way is that scammers will develop chrome extensions that look similar to legitimate ones like Metamask. By impersonating the real applications, users often are led to letting their guard down and provide their private key to use the new application.</p><p>One interesting tactic we noticed is that scammers will also try to trick users into thinking there is a new bug/vulnerability with existing applications and there is a new software upgrade. We detected a scammer trying to trick users into thinking the current Metamask version had a bug and users should upgrade to the new version. The scammer proclaimed in the message that the new upgrade is not out yet so the upgrade has to be done manually this time. He afterwards gave a set of instructions which aims to trick the user into providing his metamask password which will expose his private key to the scammer.</p><p>In this scenario, users should always wait for the official announcement from Metamask and upgrade their Metamask version from official sources.</p><p>To upgrade an extension, just head to chrome://extensions/ </p><p>Click on the update button</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-3" src="/hashdit/assets/images/3-6b4a6e12e3286d913865d9ee6d519f95.png" width="512" height="148" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This will update all your extensions accordingly.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-friendly-reminder">A friendly reminder:<a class="hash-link" href="#a-friendly-reminder" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Normal application upgrades WILL NOT require a user to provide sensitive information such as login credentials. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-ice-phishing">2: Ice-Phishing<a class="hash-link" href="#2-ice-phishing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>This is a tactic where the user is tricked into signing a transaction that gives an attacker control over the user’s tokens, without the leakage of his private keys. This is an extension of the Phishing technique.</p><p>For some background, when a user is using DeFi applications (e.g PancakeSwap) and interacting with the main token standards (e.g. ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155) the approval method is shown on their metamask window. This is a request for the user to delegate authority to a 3rd party to act on behalf of that user on those tokens. Afterwards, the user can perform other operations like performing a swap.</p><p>Attackers will direct users to the phishing website and induce them to sign some transactions that they didn't request. For example, the interacted contract might not even be a contract, but the attacker’s address. Once the approval transaction is done, the attacker has the authority to transfer funds out of the victim’s wallet.</p><p>Usually, the scam website has an algorithm to scan the victim’s wallet to detect the valuable assets such as an expensive BAYC NFT or cryptocurrencies like WBTC or WETH. Often, the website will continually show the metamask window to prompt users to sign another transaction even though they may have already signed once.</p><p>Another way to prevent being a victim of Ice-Phishing is to stay away from signing eth_sign transactions. They usually look something like this: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-4" src="/hashdit/assets/images/4-3c0c1ee97c3cf13145e1c0896e83c06c.png" width="344" height="489" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The method eth_sign is an open-ended signing method that allows signing an arbitrary hash, which means it can be used to sign unclear transactions, or any other data, making it a dangerous phishing risk.</p><p>An arbitrary hash here means that the usual suspects of approve or approve for all methods are not the only possible methods, the scammer can make you sign transactions like native token transfer or a contract call. Essentially, having almost full control of your account without even holding your private key!</p><p>Although MetaMask will display a risk warning when signing eth_sign requests, when combined with other phishing techniques, it can still be possible for users with no security experience to fall for these traps.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-event-spoofing--nft-sleep-minting">3: Event Spoofing &amp; NFT Sleep Minting<a class="hash-link" href="#3-event-spoofing--nft-sleep-minting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="event-spoofing">Event Spoofing<a class="hash-link" href="#event-spoofing" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Event spoofing is a tactic where scammers transfer random BEP20 tokens to users, and prompt users to interact with it. The catch is that even though the scammer is the one transferring the tokens, from the blockchain explorer like BscScan, it will show that the source of funds were from a separate wallet such as Binance Hot Wallet. Then, they will be enticed to interact with these new ‘free’ tokens which can lead to users to phishing websites by displaying a link in the token name or the code itself. This is an extension of the Phishing technique.</p><p>This method takes advantage of how blockchain explorers show events. </p><p>For example, this screenshot from BscScan shows CHI being sent from

Note: this isn’t particularly a bug with blockchain explorers, but more of the flexibility to change parameters since BscScan cannot know for sure whether the parameters are accurate. As such, scammers can use this to their advantage and spoof the source of funds.</p><p>Look at our twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HashDit/status/1557536292979855360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> for such an example! </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nft-sleep-minting">NFT Sleep Minting<a class="hash-link" href="#nft-sleep-minting" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Building on plain BEP20 event spoofing, scammers can be creative with how they execute their scam. NFT Sleep Minting is when a scammer mints an NFT directly to a famous creator’s wallet. However, the NFT code has a backdoor method where the scammer can reclaim the NFT back. This creates the appearance that (1) the famous creator authentically minted an NFT to themselves; and then (2) sent that NFT to a scammer. Based on the “on-chain” provenance, the scammer can claim they own an NFT minted by a famous creator and sell it for a higher value, faking the value in the process.</p><p>The deception of Sleep Minting comes from the fact that you can emit any piece of data in an Event log. One would expect that if the user sends a transaction to transfer an NFT, then your address should be in the Event log as the “from” field. However, that is not the case when a scammer reclaims a sleep-minted NFT from a famous creator. A scammer could artificially place the famous creator’s address in a Transfer Events “from” field, completing the illusion.</p><p>For exmaple, we can take a look at Beeple's <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc6b0562605d35ee710138402b878ffe6f2e23807#tokentxnsErc721" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">account</a> and observe several NFTS minted to him, and not exactly minted by him.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="4-ponzi-scams">4: Ponzi Scams<a class="hash-link" href="#4-ponzi-scams" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In these scams, there is usually no real strategy to earn rewards or make profits. Essentially, the whole scheme uses the money of new investors to pay the old investors. Once there is no more new money coming in to support the scheme, the whole system will fail.</p><p>There are several telltale signs in a Crypto Ponzi Scam:</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="first-the-project-side-collects-tax-fees-and-these-fees-keep-users-longer-in-the-ecosystem">First, the project side collects tax fees and these fees keep users longer in the ecosystem.<a class="hash-link" href="#first-the-project-side-collects-tax-fees-and-these-fees-keep-users-longer-in-the-ecosystem" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Since every deposit/compounding action incurs some sort of fees, this means that the user has to compound for a longer period of time in order to break even. These fees are also used to pay back the dividends of the users who want to claim. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="second-there-is-no-way-to-withdraw-the-users-initial-invested-funds">Second, there is no way to withdraw the user's initial invested funds.<a class="hash-link" href="#second-there-is-no-way-to-withdraw-the-users-initial-invested-funds" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Once one user deposits their initial tokens, there is no way for him to withdraw back his initial invested funds. The only way for the user to get back any funds is to claim back dividends. </p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-third-way-is-using-a-referral-system">The third way is using a referral system.<a class="hash-link" href="#the-third-way-is-using-a-referral-system" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>The project encourages participants to actively promote and refer others through the referrer benefits. The upline will receive additional rewards whenever a downline performs certain actions. Also, in order for a user to start participating in the protocol, he has to have an upline address to start. This creates a system where each address is linked to another, similar to a pyramid scheme. There are increased bonuses for having more than 5 downline addresses too.</p><p>A common theme that one will see is a steep rise in funds locked in the contract at the start, usually driven by the initial hype through marketing by the team or funds pumped by the team themselves to generate activity. Once the contract’s balance has reached an inflection point, this means there are no new funds coming in. This will slowly result in the scheme falling apart and the new investors panicking to withdraw as much dividends as possible.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-7" src="/hashdit/assets/images/7-dcce16bd7e1505d8598e8de18f327eec.png" width="512" height="237" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>At the end of the day, the project party which solely earns the tax fees will be the biggest beneficiary for such Ponzi scam projects.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="5-chi-gas-token-farming">5: CHI Gas token farming<a class="hash-link" href="#5-chi-gas-token-farming" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>CHI Gas token is an initiative by 1inch project, where the Chi Gastoken is a BEP20 token that is meant to be used on 1inch exchange to pay transaction costs. Chi is pegged to the network’s gas price. When the gas price is low, the Chi price is also low, and the opposite. </p><p>How scammers make use of this is very interesting. First, they would airdrop a bunch of random BEP20 tokens. When the user approves PancakeSwap to sell these tokens, in the approve() method of these tokens it will hard coded to consume a large amount (e.g above 90%) of the user's gas limit to mint Chi Gastoken which can be used to subsidize the gas fee, the minted Chi Gastoken are the profit of the scammers. </p><p>It is recommended to pay attention to the consumed condition of gas fee in approval transactions before calling the approve() function in some airdrop tokens.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="in-general-dont-touch-random-tokens-airdropped-to-you">In general, don’t touch random tokens airdropped to you<a class="hash-link" href="#in-general-dont-touch-random-tokens-airdropped-to-you" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>Look at our twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/HashDit/status/1573330966969720835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> for such an example!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="6-mev-scams--scam-events">6: MEV Scams / Scam Events<a class="hash-link" href="#6-mev-scams--scam-events" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crypto-jargon">Crypto Jargon<a class="hash-link" href="#crypto-jargon" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Scammers will make use of crypto jargon like “MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)”, “Arbitrage trading bot”, “Sniper bot”, “Front-run bot” promising passive income of a few thousand dollars a day to entice users to participate. These are usually promoted on platforms like Twitter, Tiktok and Blockchain Explorers.</p><p>Usually, scammers will attach a video link to the post where victims are brought to video hosting platforms like Youtube and Vimeo.</p><p>Example:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-8" src="/hashdit/assets/images/8-b6e359ba54338512b3374ad06d7c1b78.png" width="512" height="396" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Essentially, the scam video will guide the user to deploy their malicious code using the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remix IDE</a>, they will provide the malicious code usually in a pastebin url in the video description. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-9" src="/hashdit/assets/images/9-0f8d752a84affbe63959b6bb09185835.png" width="291" height="164" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>With the code now deployed on-chain, the user will be instructed to next prepare some native funds to perform the ‘front run or arbitrage’. The scam video will prompt the user to prepare more native funds so that when you perform the ‘front run or arbitrage’ operation, you will be able to make more profits, tricking the user. Once the user injects the funds into the contract and ‘starts the front run’, instead of earning him profits like what the scammer claims to do, the funds will be directly transferred to the scammer</p><p>Another relatively new way is for scammers to provide a link for CEX (Centralized Exchange) trading bots such as the screenshot here.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-10" src="/hashdit/assets/images/10-ef6508347805a96c36af39aef5621f25.png" width="512" height="402" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Users will be prompted to download a malicious file and follow the instructions. Usually, users that want to trade on Binance Exchange automatically will have an API key. This scam video tricks users into using their trading bot and asking users to give up their API key and the password for it. Once the user is scammed into doing so, the scammer will be able to receive the user’s credentials on their end and trade with the user’s funds now.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="crypto-event">Crypto Event<a class="hash-link" href="#crypto-event" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>In such situations, scammers also use social media to spread fake information of a giveaway being done by notable players in the space such as crypto exchanges or projects.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-11" src="/hashdit/assets/images/11-df614a07eda4ac91b0def2b8ca11a9f1.png" width="512" height="304" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Users will be prompted to enter this link and are instructed to “verify” their address first. In order to so, they have to send some BTC or BNB to the specified address and in return they will get back 10x of the amount. At the same time, the scam website shows a transaction history of the giveaway records to trick users into thinking that the giveaway is real and works. However in reality, once the crypto is sent by the user, the funds will be lost to the scammer and there will be no rewards to receive in the end. </p><p>Oftentimes, scammers might use old videos or even resort to deep faking a popular figure, to trick users into thinking that the person is endorsing and promoting a new giveaway. When in reality, this cannot be further away from the truth.</p><p>A common similarity among these cases is that there will be fake engagement in the video’s comment section. This is to psychologically trick users into thinking that this trading bot really works well.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-12" src="/hashdit/assets/images/12-0ef4367a8820ffe0cf7fa3cc77c790e4.png" width="401" height="512" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Also, if this is in the description, <strong>RUN</strong>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rugged. Rugged. Rugged.</p><p>If you are a DeFi investor, you have definitely heard of these words. As newly DeFi projects mushroom to BSC chain each day, not all of them are good —— be careful, they might steal your investment! According to the 200 most recently launched DeFi project analysis in RugDoc, 28% of them are tagged as “High Risk”, which means that they are highly likely to lead to catastrophic losses as they are right now, and 29% of them are marked as “Some Risk” that have ability to perform soft rug, and only 43% of them are “Low Risk” or “No Risk”.</p><p>In other words, there is more than 28% probability that you lost all your the investment on DeFi project (if you randomly picked one!). Such lost maybe due to ignorance, credulous, or lack of learning. So, how do you control the risk of investment in DeFi and how to identify whether the project has a high likelihood of screwing you over? This article helps you to spot a potential rug DeFi project by following some simple steps, which only takes around 10 minutes. Remember, scammers are becoming smarter and smarter and they are able to disguise their project to make it look safe. So, even if you find a project with no obvious problem —— proceed with caution!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-1-verify-the-contract-you-are-interacting-with">Step 1: Verify the contract you are interacting with<a class="hash-link" href="#step-1-verify-the-contract-you-are-interacting-with" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When we enter a project’s website, they may have a reference to which MasterChef contract you are interacting with. However, it might be a lie! The contract you are actually interacting with may be different to the one they posted on the website. To verify this, the most trustable way is to do a “test” transaction: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-1" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-30-20-4308a81f76f3bbbb621ce2bb7c7ebb15.png" width="1200" height="918" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Take MetaMask as an example, the contract you are actually interacting with is shown on the right corner. Copy it with a left click and check whether the contract address is the same as they show to you. Also make sure the contract source code is “verified” by BscScan (check whether there is a green mark above “Contract Name”). </p><p>(Verified contract has a green mark above “Contract Name”)</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-2" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-30-51-3c4c6ed5e2ef7c7235e7d035969e4e15.png" width="2719" height="493" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-2-check-the-owner-of-contracts">Step 2: Check the “owner” of contracts<a class="hash-link" href="#step-2-check-the-owner-of-contracts" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>In a DeFi project, the MasterChef contract is the one who manages most operations, and you can verify the MasterChef contract by following step 1. However, MasterChef is super-powerful, and should not be owned by a regular address. Honest developers will create a Timelock contract to own the MasterChef, and each write operation by the owner to MasterChef will be delayed for a period of time, giving you time to take your investment out if developers made any mistake. On the other hand, evil scammers try to own the MasterChef themselves —— so that they can take away your money in a second. Usually, the ownership graph between each contract is shown as follows: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-3" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-30-51-3c4c6ed5e2ef7c7235e7d035969e4e15.png" width="2719" height="493" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Such verification can be done by reading the contract variable and verifying the addresses on BscScan. Let’s walk through this process with an example of PancakeSwap:</p><ol><li>Find the PancakeSwap MasterChef (0x73feaa1ee314f8c655e354234017be2193c9e24e) on BscScan.com, and click on “Read Contract”. </li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-4" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-31-58-05521596b606f814498cfd2b8122feec.png" width="1213" height="195" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="2"><li>Find the “owner” variable of the MasterChef.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-5" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-32-53-ae771648436feaaf4d528346c0df147f.png" width="751" height="159" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="3"><li>Click on the address link, and we found that it is a Timelock contract.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-6" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-33-41-969cffba4635ade5f5a769aef650e65e.png" width="1209" height="482" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="4"><li>Next, find the Token contract in MasterChef, the PancakeSwap token is named “cake”. This might vary from projects. </li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-7" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-34-41-aff04a1242c1ec719ada2c6ad505fee3.png" width="779" height="143" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="5"><li>Click on it, and find whether the owner of “cake” is the MasterChef contract we came from. </li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-8" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-35-0-50503266096005efb169c9b0daacb72c.png" width="747" height="132" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="6"><li>Compare the addresses, they are the same! Meaning that the PancakeSwap project is safe (for now), Hoo-Yeah!</li></ol><p>Note: When checking the Timelock and Token contracts, make sure that they are “verified” by BscScan!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-3-check-upgradable-proxy--timelock-duration">Step 3: Check upgradable proxy &amp; Timelock duration<a class="hash-link" href="#step-3-check-upgradable-proxy--timelock-duration" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If a project’s MasterChef uses “upgradable proxy” (if you don’t know what is an upgradable proxy, Click Here), then its code is totally modifiable by its owners. For such powerful contract like MasterChef, you generally do not want it be easily changed —— cause the developers may replace the original MasterChef with an evil one. Thus making sure the project’s MasterChef do not use proxy is very important. When you clicking on the “Contract”, you do NOT want to see these extra buttons: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-9" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-35-28-b9f14a2d7a3369cccc9d623b500972f4.png" width="1328" height="204" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The “Read as Proxy” and “Write as Proxy” means that they are using upgradable proxy to deploy their contracts. It does not always mean the end of the world, but you would better ask the developers why did they do so —— and they’d better give a reasonable answer.</p><p>In the previous step, we told you to check the Timelock contract, but we also need to make sure that the Timelock is actually locking some “time”! To verify this, we go to the “Read Contract” of Timelock: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-10" src="/hashdit/assets/images/image_23-36-16-d8bfa482bbb1956fe3a75c8b48ca741e.png" width="1197" height="1586" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>As you can see here, the minimum delay of this Timelock is 21600 seconds, which is 6 hours, and the current delay is set to 21700 seconds. This mean that the developers’ action will be delayed for at least 6 hours before they take actual effects. Generally, you want the minimum delay time to be set above 6 hours —— to not worry about your investments while you are asleep.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="step-4-check-commonly-evil-features">Step 4: Check commonly evil features<a class="hash-link" href="#step-4-check-commonly-evil-features" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>There can be lots of evil code hiding inside the contracts, and finding all of them is super time-consuming. Luckily, there are some commonly-used evil features by the scammers, and if you find the project you are about to invest contains one, or multiple of the following code, be careful, you might get rugged!</p><ul><li>(High Risk) If they have the “migrate” function in MasterChef. (Except PancakeSwap)</li><li>(High Risk) Search “fee =&gt; 10000” and see if they have any fee up to 100%.</li><li>(High Risk) If they have “setVaultAddress” function in MasterChef.</li><li>(High Risk) Go to their website, check whether “Total Value Locked” matches the sum up from their Liquidity Pools.</li><li>(Medium Risk) Check whether the number of “poolLength” in MasterChef matches the actual pool numbers on their website.</li><li>(Medium Risk) If they have “updateStartBlock” function in MasterChef, it might causes severe bug to the project if not used correctly.</li><li>(Medium Risk) If their code highly matched the Panther project (0x058451c62b96c594ad984370eda8b6fd7197bbd4), then proceed with caution because Panther itself have some “risks” due to operator privileges, and the newly started DeFi project are more tend to abuse them.</li></ul><p>Woo-hoo! You luckily find your target DeFi project “passed” all the steps listed above and is going to dip into it…. Wait a minute! Passing this 10-minute test does not mean that it is totally safe, if you want to invest your lifetime money into it, think twice! As I mentioned above, this guide only helps you to make sure that the project does not do an “obvious rug”, but what if the scammers are smart? Here are some extra assessments you can do to lower your risk:</p><ul><li>Check the top token holders of the project, they usually are the burn address or the staking contract.</li><li>Look deeper into the code and find if the dev is able to drain funds or unlimitedly emit new tokens to itself.</li><li>Track the transactions and ask dev team for any odd moves you found. Good dev will always give you space to ask questions.</li><li>Search on the twitter &amp; any public rug scanning community about the project, if they have not done the review on it yet, submit a request.</li><li>Find whether the contract code has any audit. They’d better have one or two paid audits to prove their code security.</li><li>Do not put all your eggs in one bucket, and never invest what you can’t lose.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
