However,  1 particular incident (0.5%) was a white-hat hack. The white-hat <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/hashflow-users-made-whole-after-600k-exploit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hack</a> is related to a Hashflow project, where an old contract had an Open Approval, this means that any users that have approved funds to the victim contract can have his existing funds stolen.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-8" src="/hashdit/assets/images/Proportion_Exploit_Type-11228b3ddf1c7a3f24c69d20bc6a16b4.png" width="2882" height="848" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 5: Proportion of different type of exploits</p><p>However, it is interesting to note that even when the number of hacks are nearly doubled to that of scams, the financial impact of hacks were less significant than the ones related to the scams.

In 2022, the number of scam incidents was double that of hack cases, with the financial loss of hacks being double that of scams. You can refer to our previous [report]((https://hashdit.github.io/hashdit/blog/bsc-2022-end-of-year-report/)) for more information.<p>The observed trend potentially signifies an escalating presence of scammers within the crypto space. Their tactics continuously evolve, challenging users&#x27; vigilance. Furthermore, smaller, lesser-known projects may exhibit comparatively lower emphasis on security measures. This underscores the pressing need for heightened awareness and diligence across the ecosystem to safeguard against emerging threats. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="specific-attack-vectors">Specific attack vectors<a class="hash-link" href="#specific-attack-vectors" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Figure 7 displays the specific attack vectors against its financial loss in 2023 H1.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="IMG-10" src="/hashdit/assets/images/Type_of_exploits_this_month-595262bb3c1cd52242640ec44acc6759.png" width="2882" height="888" class="img_ev3q"></p><p align="center">Figure 7: Proportion of the funds lost comparing the different type of vulnerabilities</p><p>Looking at the breakdown, the most common loss of funds was attributed to Rugpulls (25%),  while the second most common attack vector was due to  Reflection Vulnerability. Several token smart contracts deployed on BSC utilize the Reflection mechanism for token holders to gain dividends, however the reflection implementation might be flawed, leading to its liquidity pool being drained by malicious actors. The third most common attack vector was Price Manipulation at 8.2%. This is common as well since poorly designed smart contracts rely on the instantaneous price of liquidity pools, and hence can be easily manipulated by a large Swap trade or Flash Loan by hackers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="type-of-projects">Type of projects<a class="hash-link" href="#type-of-projects" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>When comparing the types of project with the observed financial loss, a whopping 98.8% of financial loss were attributed to DeFi projects.

The ippswap project executed a concerning action by exploiting a privileged backdoor method, takeToken(), within the staking contract. This unauthorized maneuver allowed the project party to transfer IPPSwap LP Tokens, which had been staked by users, directly to their own account.  Liquidity was then subsequently removed using the above LP tokens to gain $14,535,741.86 USDT.</p><p>Some of the USDT funds flowed onto Binance exchange where the funds have been frozen by the Binance team.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="safemoon---89-million-loss">Safemoon - $8.9 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#safemoon---89-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The Safemoon project was exploited for $8.9 million USD on 29-Mar-2023. The Safemoon liquidity pool was compromised after a code upgrade introduced a bug, a public burn() function. The hacker was able to burn the SFM tokens in the liquidity pool, artificially inflating the price of the SFM tokens, and then sold sufficient tokens to wipe out all the WBNB in the pool.</p><p>On April 20, the SafeMoon attacker returned 80% of the stolen funds, and transferred 21,804 BNB (approximately $7.2 million) to the SafeMoon vault wallet, taxing the remaining 20% as a bounty.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="swapx---73-million-loss">SwapX - $7.3 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#swapx---73-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>SwapX, a DeFi project, faced an Open Approval issue starting from 27-Feb-2023, resulting in users losing more than $7.3 million USD. Users of BSCex / SwapX, a DEX on BNB Chain, had their funds stolen from their wallets. Vulnerabilities were found in four old contracts (deployed on Jan. 2021, May. 2021, July 2021, and Oct. 2021) belonging to the DEX. Many users still have active approvals to these contracts, even though they have not used it for a long time. Affected users remain at risk as long as they have not revoked their approvals.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="atlantis-loans---35-million-loss">Atlantis Loans - $3.5 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#atlantis-loans---35-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>On 12-June-2023, Atlantis Loans faced a malicious Governance proposal takeover, coupled with the abandonment by the core team whichresulted in ~$3.5 million USD loss. On April 12, its official TG channel was deleted and a backup channel was created instead, with multiple users of the community claiming that the project had been abandoned and that they are trying to build it up again. A malicious proposal was then submitted to take over the core contracts of Atlantis Loans which was successfully shut down by the new project party.</p><p>However, a similar proposal was submitted on June 12, and was not blocked this time, which resulted in the hacker stealing funds from users that have approved the Atlantis Loans core contracts.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fut---27-million-loss">$FUT - $2.7 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#fut---27-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Early this year on 4-Jan-2023, the $FUT project team conducted a rugpull for $2.7 million USD. The project party was able to invoke the privileged function withdrawSushiReward() of the Masterchef contract to transfer all the FCS to another controlled wallet. He then subsequently swapped all his FCS for $FUT before exiting for USDT. Once again, this shows the risk of over-centralization by the project party, as they have too many privileges and can easily backdoor funds from users.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="circulate---23-million-loss">Circulate - $2.3 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#circulate---23-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>On 12-Jan-2023, the Circulate Ponzi managed to scam around $2.3 million USD from users. The CirculateBUSD and CirculateWBNB contracts promised users high APR by depositing funds with them. When users deposit funds, they invoke the startTrading() method of the contract, this in turn calls a third party dependency: SwapHelper contract which is unverified. However, upon decompiling the code, we noticed that there was a hardcoded condition that when the contract reached $2m of staked funds, the funds will be immediately transferred to a designated project team’s address.</p><p>Although it is currently unknown how the scammer in this incident was able to get large investment into their recently created contracts (~2 days), it is highly likely that the contracts were scams from the beginning due to design bugs in the SwapHelper contract.
On the whole, third party dependencies in smart contracts present a security risk. Whilst reliance on third parties such as the use of oracles is sometimes unavoidable, developers should avoid these dependencies as much as possible. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="yieldrobot---21-million-loss">YieldRobot - $2.1 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#yieldrobot---21-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>On 17-Jan-2023, YieldRobot scammed users of around $2.1 million USD. For context, YieldRobot is a De-Fi protocol which promises to give yield for users that deposit BUSD.
Two days prior to the incident, the YieldRobot contract deployer wallet set the signer to a new EOA (0x3f531). The signer address is needed to approve the redemption of coupons.</p><p>In order to redeem a coupon it must pass a check to verify it has the correct signer. Once approved, the coupon is added to the user’s reward balance. In this incident, 0x8f2DB called setCoupon() which credited them 2.1m BUSD.</p><p>The new signer approved the malicious coupon redemption, as such he was able to claimRewards of the contract’s BUSD balance and drain all the BUSD funds.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="liango-protocol---16-million-loss">LianGo Protocol - $1.6 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#liango-protocol---16-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>On 7-Feb-2023, the LianGo protocol was exploited for $1.6 million USD, roughly 6,148,859 LGT reward coins were stolen. For context, LianGo is a decentralized payment consumption and LGT is their main token.</p><p>The reason for the theft was that the owner administrator of LGTPool created a fake LP token pledge pool (pool 3), and then the thief put a large amount of LP tokens into the pool, pledged and obtained 6.14 million LGT reward tokens. </p><p>Based on on-chain data, the thief has been preparing for the theft for a long time. 58 days before the incident, the stealer’s address obtained the gas fee from Tornado Cash, and deployed the fake LP contract 32 days before the incident.</p><p>Then on the same day the LianGoPay project deployed the trading pair contracts of LGT tokens and WBNB on Pancake. This contract address is very similar to the address of the fake LP contract that was deployed earlier -- the 4 letters before and after are the same, which can be easily confused. As such, it is likely a private key compromise to the project’s back end system.</p><p>The administrator of the LGTPool contract initiated three consecutive transactions to create pledge pools, the first two of which also created a real one when creating two fake LP token pledge pools (pools 3 and 4). LP token pool for WBNB and LGT. Because the front and rear four digits of the real and fake LP token contract addresses are the same, it is difficult for users to detect that the first two created LP pools are fake LP pools. </p><p>Then the attacker launched an attack, first deploying an attack contract. When the contract was initialized, a huge amount of fake LP tokens was pledged for the fake No. 3 LP pledge pool - up to 614885935211982505426257800000000.</p><p>Then the attacker initiated a redemption transaction and received the rewarded LGT tokens. Because of the huge amount of pledged principal, 6.14 million LGT rewards were generated. These reward tokens were exchanged for 1.62 million BSC-USD tokens and transferred to an address starting with 0xCb65 (this address used to receive gas fees from Tornado Cash 58 days before the incident).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="deusdao-dei---13-million-loss">DeusDAO (DEI) - $1.3 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#deusdao-dei---13-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>On 6-May-2023, the DeusDAO (DEI) project was hacked for slightly more than $1.3 million USD due to a wrong contract upgrade. The project was hacked on 3 different chains: Ethereum, Arbitrum and on the BNB Chain. The upgrade bug introduced a public burn vulnerability, which allowed attackers to steal funds from other wallets that have DEI tokens.</p><p>The issue was specifically in the burnFrom method, which wrongly swapped the 2 parameters of msg.sender and the account to be granted approval. The hacker essentially approved DEI tokens to a whale account with a large amount of DEI tokens, and then invoked the wrongly implemented burnFrom method with 0 tokens. This approves all the DEI tokens to the caller instead, where he can just simply call transferFrom and steal all his tokens.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>BSC continues to be a strong competitor, outperforming Ethereum in terms of daily active users and verified contracts.

This shows that the number of security exploits with high financial impact is decreasing. Such decrease could be explained by the fact that projects with important funds are better secured and are more battle-tested.

Essentially, there was a bug in the proof verification which allowed the attacker to forge arbitrary messages and include them in a block that wouldn’t be verified. Fortunately, the attacker here only forged two messages, so the damage could have been far worse.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="qubitfinance---80-million-loss">QubitFinance - $80 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#qubitfinance---80-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>On 27th Jan 2022, the Qubit protocol was exploited, resulting in almost $80M loss. Qubit Bridge is essentially a platform for users to collateralize their ETH on the Ethereum chain without moving assets to BSC. The incident was due to a flawed minting functionality of qXETH on BSC where the tokens were later used for borrowing assets via Qubit lending.</p><p>Root cause analysis was that a legacy function (deposit) remained in the Qbridge Handler contract after it was replaced by a newer function (depositETH).</p><p>The legacy function did not check the amount of tokens, in this case WETH, supposed to be transferred in. As a result, the attacker was able to pass in the 0x0 address to fake a deposit event.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="evodefi---50-million-loss">EvoDefi - $50 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#evodefi---50-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>The team behind EVODeFi, a cross-chain platform offering a set of crypto products on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) &amp; Polygon, invested users’ funds on Terra’s Anchor Protocol in order to fund their cross-platform bridge as well as sustain high APR on ValleySwap, the second project owned by the team. In a further effort to boost APR on ValleySwap, the team minted unbacked USDT, causing funds on Oasis Emerald to be unbacked, the network ValleySwap was based on.</p><p>However, due to the collapse of Terra’s ecosystem, EVODeFi lost their investment in Anchor Protocol, their unbacked USDT became worthless, and they had no liquidity to continue operations.</p><p>Thus, EVODeFi was forced to close their bridge, trapping millions of dollars worth of users’ funds on Oasis, with no way to move funds out of Oasis Network without losing a majority of their fund’s value.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="stablefund---23-million-loss">StableFund - $23 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#stablefund---23-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>StableFund was identified to be a Ponzi scheme. The project team can get a risk-free 3% handling fee, while it was marketed that the participants can get 1.5% rewards every day, and they can choose to get their principal back after 4 weeks.</p><p>In reality, the project does not have any profit-making method, to sustain the high 1.5% daily yield. The rewards of the first entrants need to be paid by the principal of the latter entrants, this is the standard Ponzi feature.</p><p>The project started from 2022-06-27, where &gt;13k addresses have participated, and more than $23 million have been invested into the pools so far.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="elephant-money---22-million-loss">Elephant Money - $22 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#elephant-money---22-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>On 13th April 2022, Elephant Money was exploited, resulting in the loss of 27,416.46 BNB. The attacker first used WBNB to buy a large amount of ELEPHANT, and then used BUSD to mint the TRUNK stablecoin. During the minting process, the Elephant contract will convert BUSD to WBNB and then back to ELEPHANT to drive up the ELEPHANT price.</p><p>The root cause was that the vulnerable contract relied on the instantaneous price of ELEPHANT-WBNB liquidity pool. Since, the value of ELEPHANT was artificially inflated, the attacker could mint more TRUNK stablecoin, which he can redeem back for WBNB and BUSD.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="transit-finance---21-million-loss">Transit Finance - $21 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#transit-finance---21-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>On 1st October 2022, Transit Finance / Swap (a cross-chain protocol) was exploited for &gt; $21m. Essentially, this attack targeted the users directly via a vulnerability in the use of the transferFrom() function. Any tokens approved for trading on Transit Swap could be transferred directly from users’ wallets to the unknown exploiter’s address.</p><p>Thankfully, &gt; $18.9m was returned back to Transit Finance on both chains (ETH and BNB).</p><p>The root cause was that there was a lack of validation for input parameters. The hacker parsed in the Permissions management contract to the vulnerable contract and called the claimTokens function to do a transferFrom from users that have unlimited approval to this contract.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ankr--helio---20-million-loss">ANKR / Helio - $20 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#ankr--helio---20-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>On 2nd December 2022, Ankr protocol was exploited for around $5m, but what was surprising was 1 of their products, Helio, was impacted as well for &gt; $15m, bringing the total damage to &gt; $20m. Essentially, the root cause was that the private key of the Ankr deployer was compromised. According to the team, it was an insider attack that stole the private key. As such, the exploiter introduced a backdoor function and minted a large amount of unbacked aBNBc tokens to drain the liquidity pool for BNB.</p><p>Helio was impacted because one of the ways to provide collateral on their platform was aBNBc. Since the value of aBNBc has plummeted, many users seized the opportunity to purchase it at a valuation below market value. At the same time, Helio uses Chainlink to reflect the actual value of BNB at that point of time. As such, these users had a higher collateral value than expected where they could borrow large amounts of $HAY (platform’s stablecoin) and not pay back the debt.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss">Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol - $20 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#racoon-network-and-freedom-protocol---20-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>On 20th July 2022, Racoon Network and Freedom Protocol performed a rugpull. More than 20 million USDT were transferred to the same EOA address, suggesting that they belong to the same party. 10% of the funds were transferred from Raccoon Network, while 90% of the funds were transferred from Freedom Protocol.</p><p>For Raccoon Network, the loophole is in the unverified token contract, Raccoon Network Token (RAC). In this token, every time a user transfers a RAC token, there is a 6% tax and the tax fees are transferred to an EOA, where the malicious project party could cash out to USDT anytime.</p><p>For the Freedom Protocol, the project party collected USDT by selling their NFTs at a price of 100 USDT. Afterwards, they did not continue their development and the funds have since been transferred out through CEXs.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="flare---17-million-loss">$FLARE - $17 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#flare---17-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>On 14th November 2022, $FLARE token conducted an exit scam of ~$17m. Essentially, the root cause was the victim contract (unverified) allowed the attacker to use a faketoken as input to call getUserInfo() and then set some value to the &quot;balance&quot; related data structure.</p><p>The project has a rewards contract which rewards users who have invested USDT, in exchange they get USDT. Internally, there is this “balance” related data structure which calls the investing contract and getUserInfo() to keep track of how much tokens have been invested.</p><p>However, the lack of input validation allowed the exploiter to parse the address input of his faketoken, with the necessary getUserInfo() method and fake his amount invested.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss">DEGO Finance / Cocos - $15 Million Loss<a class="hash-link" href="#dego-finance--cocos---15-million-loss" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>On 9th February 2022, DEGO Finance / Cocos were hacked for $15m.

However, it is undeniable that 2022 has proven to be a tough year for both investors and developers due to the bear market and hack incidents, which impeded trust within the cryptocurrency community. Below we have some final tips for investors and developers:</p><p>For investors:</p><ul><li>Understand what you&#x27;re signing, don&#x27;t blindly sign random signatures/transactions (never sign signatures outside of official websites)</li><li>Always double check that you are on the official website of the DApp</li><li>Be extra wary of new/trending projects or projects that guarantee High APYs / use MEV bots, and always verify the project team’s authenticity</li><li>Use multiple wallets for different activities (hot wallet for frequent transactions; cold wallet to store high value funds)</li><li>Ensure you are interacting with an open-source contract and revoke approval once interaction is done</li><li>Check the security and risk scores of interacted contracts (e.g when using Trust wallet)
If <em>High Risk</em> is flagged, we strongly advise to stay away</li></ul><p><strong>Feel free to reach out to our team if you have any doubts about a certain project / contract address / transaction / risk score!</strong></p><p>For developers:</p><ul><li>Verify &amp; open-source all relevant contracts on-chain (to ensure transparency and trust within the space)</li><li>Ensure the project is audited by at least 2 well-known security companies and fix all issues where applicable (Including auditing newly added code)</li><li>Incorporate / Implement a bug-bounty program to upkeep the security posture of the project and encourage the community to ensure the code remains secure</li><li>Ensure security is at the core of the business: run sufficient testing / stress-testing / simulations such as (1) adverse token price fluctuations, (2) edge cases</li><li>Prevent centralization risks by using multi signature wallets and not a single EOA wallet to run operations</li><li>Minimize contract upgradeability and only apply to contracts when necessary</li><li>Ensure funds are stored securely (key management, fund distribution)</li><li>Implement safeguards in the event of a hack (formulate an Incident Response plan, introduce time lock / pausing within the smart contract)</li><li>Constant monitoring of system parameters e.g Exchange Rate of a token</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hashdit">Hashdit<a class="hash-link" href="#hashdit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>HashDit’s core mission is to provide the essential threat intelligence for the everyday crypto investors to make informed decisions.
